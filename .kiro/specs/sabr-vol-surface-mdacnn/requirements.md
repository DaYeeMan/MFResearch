# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to rebuild a comprehensive SABR volatility surface modeling system using Multi-fidelity Data Aggregation CNN (MDA-CNN) architecture. The system will generate both high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations and low-fidelity Hagan analytical surfaces, then train an MDA-CNN model to predict residuals between MC and Hagan surfaces across entire volatility surfaces rather than single points. The goal is to achieve accurate volatility surface predictions with minimal expensive high-fidelity Monte Carlo data points.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Generation Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a quantitative researcher, I want to generate comprehensive SABR volatility surface data using both Monte Carlo simulations and Hagan analytical formulas, so that I can train multi-fidelity models with sufficient data coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system generates data THEN it SHALL create high-fidelity Monte Carlo volatility surfaces with configurable number of simulation paths
2. WHEN the system generates data THEN it SHALL create low-fidelity Hagan analytical volatility surfaces covering the same parameter space
3. WHEN generating surfaces THEN the system SHALL support configurable strike ranges, maturity ranges, and SABR parameter ranges (F0, alpha, beta, nu, rho)
4. WHEN data generation is complete THEN the system SHALL save datasets in organized folder structure with clear naming conventions
5. IF the user specifies a limited number of HF points THEN the system SHALL strategically sample across the parameter space to maximize coverage

### Requirement 2: Multi-fidelity Model Architecture

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to implement an MDA-CNN architecture that leverages both local surface patches and point features, so that I can predict volatility surface residuals with high accuracy using minimal high-fidelity data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the model THEN the system SHALL implement a CNN branch that processes local LF surface patches (e.g., 9x9 grids)
2. WHEN building the model THEN the system SHALL implement an MLP branch that processes point features (SABR parameters, strike, maturity)
3. WHEN processing inputs THEN the system SHALL concatenate CNN and MLP latent representations before final prediction
4. WHEN making predictions THEN the model SHALL output residual values D(ξ) = σ_MC(ξ) - σ_Hagan(ξ)
5. WHEN training THEN the system SHALL use appropriate loss functions (MSE) and regularization techniques

### Requirement 3: Training and Evaluation Framework

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want a comprehensive training and evaluation system that compares different model architectures and HF data budgets, so that I can demonstrate the effectiveness of the MDA-CNN approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL implement multiple baseline models (direct MLP, residual MLP without patches)
2. WHEN evaluating models THEN the system SHALL test performance across different HF data budgets (e.g., 50, 100, 200, 500 points)
3. WHEN computing metrics THEN the system SHALL calculate RMSE, MAE, and relative errors for volatility predictions
4. WHEN evaluating THEN the system SHALL assess performance separately for ATM, ITM, and OTM regions
5. WHEN training is complete THEN the system SHALL save model checkpoints and training logs

### Requirement 4: Visualization and Analysis

**User Story:** As a quantitative analyst, I want comprehensive visualization tools that show model performance and surface comparisons, so that I can analyze and validate the model's effectiveness across different market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating visualizations THEN the system SHALL plot volatility smiles comparing HF MC, LF Hagan, baseline predictions, and MDA-CNN predictions
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL create error analysis plots showing performance vs HF data budget
3. WHEN visualizing surfaces THEN the system SHALL generate 3D surface plots for different parameter combinations
4. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL create residual distribution plots before and after ML correction
5. WHEN presenting results THEN the system SHALL generate summary statistics and performance comparison tables

### Requirement 5: Project Organization and Reproducibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-organized project structure with reproducible experiments and clear documentation, so that the research can be easily understood, extended, and replicated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing the project THEN the system SHALL create separate folders for data generation, model training, evaluation, and visualization
2. WHEN running experiments THEN the system SHALL use fixed random seeds for reproducible results
3. WHEN saving outputs THEN the system SHALL organize results in clearly labeled directories with timestamps
4. WHEN documenting code THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive docstrings and comments
5. WHEN providing configuration THEN the system SHALL use configuration files for hyperparameters and experimental settings

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a computational researcher, I want the system to efficiently handle large-scale volatility surface generation and model training, so that experiments can be completed in reasonable time frames.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating MC data THEN the system SHALL support parallel processing for multiple parameter combinations
2. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL utilize GPU acceleration when available
3. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL implement efficient data loading and batching strategies
4. WHEN running experiments THEN the system SHALL provide progress tracking and estimated completion times
5. IF memory constraints exist THEN the system SHALL implement data streaming or chunking strategies
